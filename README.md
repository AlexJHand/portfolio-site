# Personal Portfolio Site

This application is my work on my professional web development portfolio. The first version of this was created as a weekend assignment during my time at Prime Digital Academy. Since then, I have updated it to reflect my growning skills and body of work. It is intentionally planned to be a living document, where I will be showcasing the latest work that I have completed as well as contact info and a short bio. 

## Built With
